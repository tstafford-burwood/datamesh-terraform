# Terraform Directory for Provisioning Foundational GCP SRDE Components

The purpose of this directory is provision certain foundational resources in GCP that pertain to the SRDE. As an example a Cloud Build Access Level is provisioned here and is separated from the [deployments](../deployments) directory. Since the Cloud Build Access Level is maintained at an Organizational Level it can be used for other projects and not necessarily the SRDE if there are future needs for this.

## General Usage

1. From a best practice approach a new branch should generally be created from the `master` or `main` branch when working on new features or updates.
    1. Run `git checkout -b <BRANCH_NAME>`
1. Change into the desired directory that needs to have infrastructure code updated.
1. Edit either the `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, or `terraform.tfvars` file, depending on what needs to be updated.
1. If there are variables which are needed but not present in the `.tfvars` file those can be added and updated as needed.
1. In order to limit any auto-approved changes being made to your infrastructure there are two options.
    1. If you want to merge back into master you can edit out any `apply` steps within the Cloud Build YAML file that this pipeline is associated to so that only an `init` and `plan` are ran to show what the potential Terraform changes will do.
    1. If you are working out of a feature branch you can create a new Cloud Build trigger to monitor the feature branch, create a new Cloud Build YAML with only an `init` and `plan` step, then verify that the `plan` output is good to proceed forward with.
1. Save your files, `git add <files>`, `git commit -m "<MESSAGE>"`, `git push`.
1. If you were working out of a feature branch you can merge back into `master`.
    1. `git checkout <master or main>`, `git merge <FEATURE_BRANCH> --no-ff`
1. A manual pipeline run may need to be started after a merge is done if no edits have been done on the `included_files` after the merge. These are generally the `.tfvars` files which are monitored for changes to start the pipeline.
